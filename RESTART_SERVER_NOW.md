# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: RESTART YOUR SERVER NOW!

## 🔄 You MUST Restart the Server After Adding API Keys

**Environment variables (like API keys) only load when the server starts!**

### Steps:

1. **Stop your current server:**
   - Look at your terminal where `npm run dev` is running
   - Press `Ctrl+C`
   - Wait until it says "Terminated" or stops completely

2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for it to say:**
   ```
   ✓ Ready in X seconds
   ○ Local: http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Then go to:** http://localhost:3000/customize

## 🎯 Where to Find AI Features

### After Restarting:

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:3000/customize

2. **Make sure:** "👕 Custom Clothing" tab is selected (should be coral/orange)

3. **Scroll down** past:
   - "Select Product & Base Color" section
   - You'll see: **"🎨 AI Design Assistant"** section
   - It now has a **coral border** to make it more visible!

4. **You should see:**
   - White box with coral border
   - Heading: "🎨 AI Design Assistant"
   - Text area for design description
   - Style dropdown
   - **"✨ Generate Design"** button (coral/orange)

## ✅ Quick Test

1. Type in text area: `Mountain landscape with coral colors`
2. Select style: `Minimalist`
3. Click: **"✨ Generate Design"**
4. Should work now! (takes 10-30 seconds)

## 🔍 If You Still Don't See It

**Check:**
- ✅ Server restarted? (most important!)
- ✅ On `/customize` page? (not `/shop` or other pages)
- ✅ "Custom Clothing" tab selected?
- ✅ Scrolled down enough?

**Try:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

## 🎉 Once You See It
